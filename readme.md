# Magpie's Nest

I am storing here data for public use and cloning. And for myself, for future use.

Part of these have been stolen here and there, where possible, I am referencing the source.

## Index

* [lectures](lectures/) datasets and files useful for students attending my crush-course on how to not screw up when using the CLI in research.

* [useful_stuff](useful_stuff/) scripts and dataset that I'd like to retrieve easily from different machines.
  - [useful_stuff/git_prompt](useful_stuff/git_prompt/) provides two scripts to enable and activate the git-prompt from login and non-login shells
