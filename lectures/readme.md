# Lectures & Courses

I am storing here data for students attending my lectures and courses:

* [HitchhikersGuide](hitchhiker/) contains the data to be downloaded for some of the excercises.
  Most of these have been freely adapted (read "stolen") from [Dr. Alberto Sartori](https://github.com/asartori86), my guide in the dark lands.
